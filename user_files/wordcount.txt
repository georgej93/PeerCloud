	       Comic Relief: migration from paper to digital
               Canon: website creation

TECHNICALS:
- BIG O Notation:
	Describes performance of algorithms
	Can describe time for execution
	Details worst case scenarios
- OOP:
	Encapsulation: the internal implementation of an object is hidden from viewpoints outside of the object
		E.g: making variables private within a class to prevent outside interference
	Abstraction: developing classes based on their functionality, not their implementation

	Inheritance: a way to reuse code from classes, allowing new classes to have access to the
		     variables / properties / methods of the class it inherits from
		E.g:
	Polymorphism: having multiple methods with the same name, but different functionality
		Overridding: compiler choses which method will execute
		Overloading: which method is chosen at runtime depending on the dynamic type of object being handled
		
- INTERFACE: sort of a "blueprint" for a class. Class extends and interface and inherits the
	     abstract classes of the interface. Guaruntees that the class will at least have an implementation 
	     of those abstract methods.

PROBLEMS:
- Egg / Ladder:
	Is a BINARY SEARCH which has O(log n) complexity
	1 Egg: drop from bottom up until it breaks
	Multi egg: find halfway point, then use one egg strat
	Infinity egg: keep halving
	For worst case scenario: do log2(number of rungs)

Very Technical Telephone Interview 10am tomorrow: 30 - 45 minutes, to confirm 
Quite a few graduate developers being interviewed
Very selective
Right problem solving skills <--
General understanding of principles
No commercial experience expected.
