hello
this
is
a
demonstration
of
the
mapreduce
functionality
of
the
peer
cloud
framework
built
for
this
project
to
be
shown
on
the
day
of
the
poster
presentation
wordcounting
is
an
often
used
example
that
is
used
to
demonstrate
the
core
principals
of
mapreduce
and
although
the
task
of
wordcounting
is
in
itself
a
trivial
one
the
focus
of
this
demonstration
should
not
be
upon
the
task
but
the
capability
of
the
framework
to
delegate
the
task
across
a
number
of
workers
which
requires
the
application
of
a
number
of
different
technologies
In
addition
to
this
a
second
demonstration
can
be
performed
today
which
finds
the
maximum
number
from
an
arbitrary
set
of
numbers
Again
although
this
is
a
simple
task
to
perform
the
fact
it
can
be
performed
by
the
framework
aptly
demonstrates
that
the
framework
is
capable
of
handling
different
tasks
submitted
by
the
user
