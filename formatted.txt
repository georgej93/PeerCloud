as
the
valley
overshadowed
by
the
Mountain
They
built
the
merry
town
of
Dale
there
in
those
days
Kings
used
to
send
for
our
smiths
and
reward
even
the
least
skillful
most
richly
Father
would
beg
us
to
take
their
sons
as
apprentices
and
pay
us
handsomely
especially
in
foodsupplies
which
we
never
bothered
to
grow
or
find
for
ourselves
Altogether
those
were
good
days
for
us
and
the
poorest
of
us
had
money
to
spend
and
to
lend
and
leisure
to
make
beautiful
things
just
for
the
fun
of
it
not
to
speak
of
the
most
marvellous
and
magical
toys
the
like
of
which
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
world
nowadays
So
my
grandfather's
halls
became
full
of
armour
and
jewels
and
carvings
and
cups
and
the
toy
market
of
Dale
was
the
wonder
of
the
North
Undoubtedly
that
was
what
brought
the
dragon
Dragons
steal
gold
and
jewels
you
know
from
men
and
elves
and
dwarves
wherever
they
can
find
them
and
they
guard
their
plunder
as
long
as
they
live
which
is
practically
for
ever
unless
they
are
killed
and
never
enjoy
a
brass
ring
of
it
Indeed
they
hardly
know
a
good
bit
of
work
from
a
bad
though
they
usually
have
a
good
notion
of
the
current
market
value
and
they
can't
make
a
thing
for
themselves
not
even
mend
a
little
loose
scale
of
their
armour
There
were
lots
of
dragons
in
the
North
in
those
days
and
gold
was
probably
getting
scarce
up
there
with
the
dwarves
flying
south
or
getting
killed
and
all
the
general
waste
and
destruction
that
dragons
make
going
from
bad
to
worse
There
was
a
most
specially
greedy
strong
and
wicked
worm
called
Smaug
One
day
he
flew
up
into
the
air
and
came
south
The
first
we
heard
of
it
was
a
noise
like
a
hurricane
coming
from
the
North
and
the
pine
trees
on
the
Mountain
creaking
and
cracking
in
the
wind
Some
of
the
dwarves
who
happened
to
be
outside
I
was
one
luckily
a
fine
adventurous
lad
in
those
days
always
wandering
about
and
it
saved
my
life
that
day
well
from
a
good
way
off
we
saw
the
dragon
settle
on
our
mountain
in
a
spout
of
flame
Then
he
came
down
the
slopes
and
when
he
reached
the
woods
they
all
went
up
in
fire
By
that
time
all
the
bells
were
ringing
in
Dale
and
the
warriors
were
arming
The
dwarves
rushed
out
of
their
great
gate
but
there
was
the
dragon
waiting
for
them
None
escaped
that
way
The
river
rushed
up
in
steam
and
a
fog
fell
on
Dale
and
in
the
fog
the
dragon
came
on
them
and
destroyed
most
of
the
warriors
the
usual
unhappy
story
it
was
only
too
common
in
those
days
Then
he
went
back
and
crept
in
through
the
Front
Gate
and
routed
out
all
the
halls
and
lanes
and
tunnels
alleys
cellars
mansions
and
passages
After
that
there
were
no
dwarves
left
alive
inside
and
he
took
all
their
wealth
for
himself
Probably
for
that
is
the
dragons
way
he
has
piled
it
all
up
in
a
great
heap
far
inside
and
sleeps
on
it
for
a
bed
Later
he
used
to
crawl
out
of
the
great
gate
and
come
by
night
to
Dale
and
carry
away
people
especially
maidens
to
eat
until
Dale
was
ruined
and
all
the
people
dead
or
gone
What
goes
on
there
now
I
don't
know
for
certain
but
I
don't
suppose
any
one
lives
nearer
to
the
Mountain
than
the
far
edge
of
the
Long
Lake
nowadays
The
few
of
us
that
were
well
outside
sat
and
wept
in
hiding
and
cursed
Smaug
and
there
we
were
unexpectedly
joined
by
my
father
and
my
grandfather
with
singed
beards
They
looked
very
grim
but
they
said
very
little
When
I
asked
how
they
had
got
away
they
told
me
to
hold
my
tongue
and
said
that
one
day
in
the
proper
time
I
should
know
After
that
we
went
away
and
we
have
had
to
earn
our
livings
as
best
we
could
up
and
down
the
lands
often
enough
sinking
as
low
as
blacksmithwork
or
even
coalmining
But
we
have
never
forgotten
our
stolen
treasure
And
even
now
when
I
will
allow
we
have
a
good
bit
laid
by
and
are
not
so
badly
off
here
Thorin
stroked
the
gold
chain
round
his
neck
we
still
mean
to
get
it
back
and
to
bring
our
curses
home
to
Smaug
if
we
can
I
have
often
wondered
about
my
father's
and
my
grandfather's
escape
I
see
now
they
must
have
had
a
private
Sidedoor
which
only
they
knew
about
But
apparently
they
made
a
map
and
I
should
like
to
know
how
Gandalf
got
hold
of
it
and
why
it
did
not
come
down
to
me
the
rightful
heir
I
did
not
get
hold
of
it
I
was
given
it
said
the
wizard
Your
grandfather
Thror
was
killed
you
remember
in
the
mines
of
Moria
by
Azog
the
Goblin
Curse
his
name
yes
said
Thorin
And
Thrain
your
father
went
away
on
the
twentyfirst
of
April
a
hundred
years
ago
last
Thursday
and
has
never
been
seen
by
you
since
True
true
said
Thorin
Well
your
father
gave
me
this
to
give
to
you
and
if
I
have
chosen
my
own
time
and
way
for
handing
it
over
you
can
hardly
blame
me
considering
the
trouble
I
had
to
find
you
Your
father
could
not
remember
his
own
name
when
he
gave
me
the
paper
and
he
never
told
me
yours
so
on
the
whole
I
think
I
ought
to
be
praised
and
thanked
Here
it
is
said
he
handing
the
map
to
Thorin
I
don't
understand
said
Thorin
and
Bilbo
felt
he
would
have
liked
to
say
the
same
The
explanation
did
not
seem
to
explain
Your
grandfather
said
the
wizard
slowly
and
grimly
gave
the
map
to
his
son
for
safety
before
he
went
to
the
mines
of
Moria
Your
father
went
away
to
try
his
luck
with
the
map
after
your
grandfather
was
killed
and
lots
of
adventures
of
a
most
unpleasant
sort
he
had
but
he
never
got
near
the
Mountain
How
he
got
there
I
don't
know
but
I
found
him
a
prisoner
in
the
dungeons
of
the
Necromancer
Whatever
were
you
doing
there
asked
Thorin
with
a
shudder
and
all
the
dwarves
shivered
Never
you
mind
I
was
finding
things
out
as
usual
and
a
nasty
dangerous
business
it
was
Even
I
Gandalf
only
just
escaped
I
tried
to
save
your
father
but
it
was
too
late
He
was
witless
and
wandering
and
had
forgotten
almost
everything
except
the
map
and
the
key
We
have
long
ago
paid
the
goblins
of
Moria
said
Thorin
we
must
give
a
thought
to
the
Necromancer
Don't
be
absurd
He
is
an
enemy
far
beyond
the
powers
of
all
the
dwarves
put
together
if
they
could
all
be
collected
again
from
the
four
corners
of
the
world
The
one
thing
your
father
wished
was
for
his
son
to
read
the
map
and
use
the
key
The
dragon
and
the
Mountain
are
more
than
big
enough
tasks
for
you
Hear
hear
said
Bilbo
and
accidentally
said
it
aloud
Hear
what
they
all
said
turning
suddenly
towards
him
and
he
was
so
flustered
that
he
answered
Hear
what
I
have
got
to
say
What's
that
they
asked
Well
I
should
say
that
you
ought
to
go
East
and
have
a
look
round
After
all
there
is
the
Sidedoor
and
dragons
must
sleep
sometimes
I
suppose
If
you
sit
on
the
door
step
long
enough
I
daresay
you
will
think
of
something
And
well
don't
you
know
I
think
we
have
talked
long
enough
for
one
night
if
you
see
what
I
mean
What
about
bed
and
an
early
start
and
all
that
I
will
give
you
a
good
breakfast
before
you
go
Before
we
go
I
suppose
you
mean
said
Thorin
Aren't
you
the
burglar
And
isn't
sitting
on
the
doorstep
your
job
not
to
speak
of
getting
inside
the
door
But
I
agree
about
bed
and
breakfast
I
like
six
eggs
with
my
ham
when
starting
on
a
journey
fried
not
poached
and
mind
you
don't
break
After
all
the
others
had
ordered
their
breakfasts
without
so
much
as
a
please
which
annoyed
Bilbo
very
much
they
all
got
up
The
hobbit
had
to
find
room
for
them
all
and
filled
all
his
sparerooms
and
made
beds
on
chairs
and
sofas
before
he
got
them
all
stowed
and
went
to
his
own
little
bed
very
tired
and
not
altogether
happy
One
thing
he
did
make
his
mind
up
about
was
not
to
bother
to
get
up
very
early
and
cook
everybody
else's
wretched
breakfast
The
Tookishness
was
wearing
off
and
he
was
not
now
quite
so
sure
that
he
was
going
on
any
journey
in
the
morning
As
he
lay
in
bed
he
could
hear
Thorin
still
humming
to
himself
in
the
best
bedroom
next
to
him
Far
over
the
misty
mountains
cold
To
dungeons
deep
and
caverns
old
We
must
away
ere
break
of
day
To
find
our
longforgotten
gold
Bilbo
went
to
sleep
with
that
in
his
ears
and
it
gave
him
very
uncomfortable
dreams
It
was
long
after
the
break
of
day
when
he
woke
up
